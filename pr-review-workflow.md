## Overview

The PR Review workflow uses Google's Gemini AI to provide comprehensive code
reviews for pull requests. It analyzes code quality, security, performance, and
maintainability while providing constructive feedback in a structured format.

## Features

â€¢ Automated PR Reviews: Triggered on PR creation, updates, or manual requests
â€¢ Comprehensive Analysis: Covers security, performance, reliability, maintainability, and functionality
â€¢ Priority-based Feedback: Issues categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
â€¢ Positive Highlights: Acknowledges good practices and well-written code
â€¢ Custom Instructions: Support for specific review focus areas
â€¢ Structured Output: Consistent markdown format for easy reading
â€¢ Failure Notifications: Posts a comment on the PR if the review process fails.

## Setup

For detailed setup instructions, including prerequisites and authentication,
please refer to the main [Getting Started](https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli/blob/772c5553bc16b99cf62f90e9b5212e574e8fd291/README.md#quick-start) section and [Authentication documentation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli/blob/772c5553bc16b99cf62f90e9b5212e574e8fd291/docs/authentication.md).

To use this workflow, you can use either of the following methods:

1. Run the `/setup-github` command in Gemini CLI on your terminal to set up workflows for your repository.
2. Copy the `gemini-pr-review.yml` file into your repository's `.github/workflows` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
curl -o .github/workflows/gemini-pr-review.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli/main/examples/workflows/pr-review/gemini-pr-review.yml
```

## Usage

### Supported Triggers

The Gemini PR Review workflow is triggered by:

â€¢ New PRs: When a pull request is opened or reopened
â€¢ PR Review Comments: When a review comment contains `@gemini-cli /review`
â€¢ PR Reviews: When a review body contains `@gemini-cli /review`
â€¢ Issue Comments: When a comment on a PR contains `@gemini-cli /review`
â€¢ Manual Dispatch: Via the GitHub Actions UI ("Run workflow")

## Interaction Flow

The workflow follows a clear, multi-step process to handle review requests:

### Automatic Reviews

The workflow automatically triggers on:

â€¢ New PRs: When a pull request is opened

### Manual Reviews

Trigger a review manually by commenting on a PR:

```
@gemini-cli /review
```

### Custom Review Instructions

You can provide specific focus areas by adding instructions after the trigger:

```
@gemini-cli /review focus on security
@gemini-cli /review check performance and memory usage  
@gemini-cli /review please review error handling
@gemini-cli /review look for breaking changes
```

### Manual Workflow Dispatch

You can also trigger reviews through the GitHub Actions UI:

1. Go to Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "Gemini PR Review" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter the PR number to review

## Review Output Format

The AI review follows a structured format, providing both a high-level summary
and detailed inline feedback.

### ðŸ“‹ Review Summary (Overall Comment)

After posting all inline comments, the action submits the review with a final
summary comment that includes:

â€¢ Review Summary: A brief 2-3 sentence overview of the pull request and the overall assessment.
â€¢ General Feedback: High-level observations about code quality, architectural patterns, positive
implementation aspects, or recurring themes that were not addressed in inline
comments.

### Specific Feedback (Inline Comments)

The action provides specific, actionable feedback directly on the relevant lines
of code in the pull request. Each comment includes:

â€¢ Priority: An emoji indicating the severity of the feedback.
  â—¦ ðŸ”´ Critical: Must be fixed before merging (e.g., security vulnerabilities, breaking
changes).
  â—¦ ðŸŸ  High: Should be addressed (e.g., performance issues, design flaws).
  â—¦ ðŸŸ¡ Medium: Recommended improvements (e.g., code quality, style).
  â—¦ ðŸŸ¢ Low: Nice-to-have suggestions (e.g., documentation, minor refactoring).
  â—¦ ðŸ”µ Unclear: Priority is not determined.
â€¢ Suggestion: A code block with a suggested change, where applicable.

Example Inline Comment:

> ðŸŸ¢ Use camelCase for function names
> 
> ```javascript
> myFunction
> ```

## Review Areas

Gemini CLI analyzes multiple dimensions of code quality:

â€¢ Security: Authentication, authorization, input validation, data sanitization
â€¢ Performance: Algorithms, database queries, caching, resource usage
â€¢ Reliability: Error handling, logging, testing coverage, edge cases
â€¢ Maintainability: Code structure, documentation, naming conventions
â€¢ Functionality: Logic correctness, requirements fulfillment

## Configuration

### Workflow Customization

You can customize the workflow by modifying:

â€¢ Timeout: Adjust `timeout-minutes` for longer reviews
â€¢ Triggers: Modify when the workflow runs
â€¢ Permissions: Adjust who can trigger manual reviews
â€¢ Core Tools: Add or remove available shell commands

### Review Prompt Customization

The AI prompt can be customized to:

â€¢ Focus on specific technologies or frameworks
â€¢ Emphasize particular coding standards
â€¢ Include project-specific guidelines
â€¢ Adjust review depth and focus areas

## Examples

### Basic Review Request

```
@gemini-cli /review
```

### Security-Focused Review

```
@gemini-cli /review focus on security vulnerabilities and authentication
```

### Performance Review

```
@gemini-cli /review check for performance issues and optimization opportunities
```

### Breaking Changes Check

```
@gemini-cli /review look for potential breaking changes and API compatibility
```
