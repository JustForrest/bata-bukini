can you tell me why Goose can't understand the basic concept of the local directory when I ask it questions like this?

Edit
I can see from your screenshot that you're having a frustrating interaction with what appears to be another AI assistant called "Goose" that's not understanding your directory-related questions.

The issue seems to be that Goose is interpreting your question about file counts in a directory as if you're asking it to directly access your local file system. Most AI assistants, including myself, don't have the ability to browse or access files on your computer unless you explicitly upload them or provide specific file paths that we can work with.

When you ask "can you tell me how many files are in this directory?" the AI needs context about:

Which specific directory you're referring to
Access to that directory's contents (either through uploaded files or command execution capabilities)
A few possible reasons for the confusion:

Lack of context: The AI doesn't know what "this directory" refers to without additional information
No file system access: Most chat-based AI assistants can't browse your local directories
Missing capabilities: The AI might not have tools to execute system commands that would list directory contents
If you're working with a coding assistant that should have local file access, you might need to provide the specific directory path or use a tool that's designed to integrate with your development environment. Some AI coding tools do have the ability to read local project structures, but they typically need explicit setup or permissions to do so.




but Goose is an agentic AI, see below:
https://block.github.io/goose/docs/goose-architecture/
https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/managing-tools/tool-permissions
https://block.github.io/goose/docs/mcp/developer-mcp
Shouldn't I be able to read local files using Goose?

Edit
You're absolutely right! Based on those documentation links, Goose is indeed an agentic AI system designed to work with local files and systems. Looking at the architecture and tool permissions documentation, Goose should definitely be able to read local directories and files.

Yes, you're absolutely correct! Based on the documentation I just reviewed, Goose is specifically designed as "your on-machine AI agent, capable of automating complex development tasks" and "is designed to carry out tasks following specified instructions. This often involves working with local files - both finding the right files to work with and modifying them safely." 
GitHub
Goose

The fact that Goose couldn't understand your basic directory question is definitely problematic. Here are some potential reasons why this might be happening:

Session Context Issues: Goose might not be properly initialized in your current working directory, or it may have lost context about where it's operating.
Tool Permissions: Based on your link about tool permissions, Goose might need explicit permission to access file system operations, and these permissions might not be properly configured.
MCP (Model Context Protocol) Issues: Goose uses extensions that connect to external systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the file system tools might not be properly loaded or enabled.
Working Directory Not Set: The documentation mentions that you should "Create a directory to save all the files or goose will default to the home directory of your system" 
Automate Your Workflow in One Go By Using AI Agents with codename goose | by Lauvanya R | Coffee Byte
 - Goose might be confused about which directory you're referring to.
Some troubleshooting steps you could try:

Explicitly specify the directory path in your question
Check if Goose has the necessary file system tools enabled
Restart your Goose session in the specific directory you want to work with
Verify that file system permissions are properly configured in your Goose setup
This is definitely a basic capability that Goose should have, so the issue is likely configuration-related rather than a fundamental limitation.




I've been having some other intermittent weird issues with Goose and was considering doing a clean install. I've had the same thoughts and issues with Docker as well and VS Code too. Would it be worth reinstalling all 3 of these? Would that be a waste of time and effort?

Edit
It's definitely worth considering, especially since you're experiencing issues across multiple development tools. Here's how I'd think about it:

Signs it's worth doing a clean install:

Multiple unrelated tools (Goose, Docker, VS Code) showing weird behavior suggests potential system-level issues
Intermittent problems are often harder to debug than consistent ones, making clean installs more appealing
If you've been using these tools for a while, accumulated configs/extensions/cache files can cause conflicts
Development tools are critical to productivity - unreliable behavior is costly
Efficient approach to minimize time/effort:

VS Code: Relatively quick wins

Export your settings/extensions list first
Consider just resetting settings or disabling extensions before full reinstall
VS Code reinstalls are usually painless
Docker: Often the biggest culprit for weird system issues

Docker problems can manifest in subtle ways across other tools
Clean Docker install + clearing all containers/images/volumes often resolves mysterious issues
Docker Desktop updates sometimes leave cruft behind
Goose: Since it's newer and you're having specific functionality issues

Might be worth trying a clean config reset before full reinstall
Check if there are known issues with your current version
Time-saving strategy:

Start with Docker (biggest potential impact)
Try Goose config reset before reinstall
VS Code last (easiest to restore)
Given that you're having issues with basic functionality (like directory access) that should definitely work, the time investment is likely worth it for the productivity gains of having reliable tools.




how do I remove Docker and Goose if they were installed with Homebrew on macOS 15.5?

Edit
To remove Docker and Goose that were installed with Homebrew on macOS 15.5:

For Docker:

bash
# Stop Docker if it's running
docker stop $(docker ps -aq) 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove all containers, images, volumes, and networks
docker system prune -a --volumes

# Uninstall Docker Desktop via Homebrew
brew uninstall --cask docker

# Clean up any remaining Docker files (optional but thorough)
rm -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker
rm -rf ~/.docker
For Goose:

bash
# Check how Goose was installed (to confirm the package name)
brew list | grep goose

# If it was installed as a cask:
brew uninstall --cask goose-ai

# If it was installed as a formula:
brew uninstall goose

# If you're not sure, try both or check with:
brew search goose
General cleanup commands:

bash
# Clean up Homebrew cache and broken symlinks
brew cleanup
brew doctor

# Optional: Remove any leftover config files
rm -rf ~/.goose  # if this directory exists
Before reinstalling, you might also want to:

bash
# Update Homebrew itself
brew update

# Then reinstall fresh versions
brew install --cask docker
brew install goose-ai  # or whatever the correct package name is
The brew doctor command will help identify any lingering issues after removal. This approach should give you a completely clean slate for both tools.




user@Mac goose % docker stop $(docker ps -aq) 2>/dev/null || true
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///Users/user/.docker/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

Edit
That error is normal - it just means Docker isn't currently running, which is fine since we're removing it anyway. You can skip the Docker cleanup commands and go straight to uninstalling:

bash
# Just uninstall Docker Desktop directly
brew uninstall --cask docker

# Clean up Docker files manually
rm -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker
rm -rf ~/.docker
If the brew uninstall --cask docker command doesn't work, try:

bash
# Check what Docker packages are installed
brew list --cask | grep docker
brew list | grep docker

# Then uninstall whatever shows up, might be:
brew uninstall --cask docker-desktop
# or
brew uninstall docker
The manual file removal will clean up any leftover Docker configuration and data files even if Docker wasn't running properly.

For Goose, you can proceed with:

bash
# Check what Goose packages exist
brew search goose
brew list | grep goose

# Then uninstall accordingly
The Docker daemon error just means Docker was already stopped/broken, so you're good to proceed with the removal.




user@Mac goose % brew list --cask | grep docker
user@Mac goose % brew list | grep docker
docker
docker-completion
user@Mac goose %

Edit
Perfect! So you have Docker installed as a regular formula (not a cask) plus docker-completion. Here's how to remove them:

bash
# Remove Docker and docker-completion
brew uninstall docker docker-completion

# Clean up Docker files manually
rm -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker
rm -rf ~/.docker
Now for Goose:

bash
# Check what Goose packages you have
brew list | grep goose
brew search goose
This will show you exactly what Goose-related packages are installed so we can remove them properly.

The regular docker formula is the Docker CLI/engine, while docker-completion provides bash/zsh completion for Docker commands. Removing both will give you a clean slate.




user@Mac goose % brew list | grep goose
block-goose-cli
block-goose
user@Mac goose %

Edit
Great! You have two Goose packages installed. Remove both:

bash
# Remove both Goose packages
brew uninstall block-goose-cli block-goose

# Clean up any remaining Goose configuration files
rm -rf ~/.goose
rm -rf ~/.config/goose
Now you can do a general Homebrew cleanup:

bash
# Clean up Homebrew cache and check for issues
brew cleanup
brew doctor
After this, you'll have completely removed both Docker and Goose. When you're ready to reinstall them fresh:

bash
# Reinstall Docker
brew install docker docker-completion

# Reinstall Goose
brew install block-goose-cli block-goose
The clean removal of both packages plus their config directories should give you a fresh start and hopefully resolve those intermittent issues you were experiencing.




image.png
I'm getting pages and pages of these messages

Edit
Those "Permission denied" errors suggest some files in the Goose config directory are protected or owned by root/another user. You can force remove them with sudo:

bash
# Stop the current rm command if it's still running (Ctrl+C)

# Force remove the Goose config directories with sudo
sudo rm -rf ~/.goose
sudo rm -rf ~/.config/goose

# Also clean up any remaining Homebrew-related files
brew cleanup --prune=all
The permission errors are happening because some Node.js cache files and binaries were created with restricted permissions, likely during Goose's MCP (Model Context Protocol) operations.

Using sudo rm -rf will bypass the permission restrictions and clean everything out. This is safe to do for config directories in your home folder that you're intentionally removing.

After this completes, you should have a completely clean removal of Goose, and you can proceed with reinstalling fresh versions when you're ready.




Here's what I want to do. I want to setup Docker and use the official MCP servers docker hosts in their repo with the Docker Gateway tool to connect arbitrary MCP servers to Goose quickly and easily. With that in mind are there any things I should be aware of on my reinstall and/or anything I should do while I reinstall? Should I reinstall in a specific order or anything?

https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/using-extensions

Edit
Great plan! Using Docker's MCP Gateway with Goose is a smart approach for managing MCP servers. Here's the optimal reinstall strategy:

Installation Order:

Docker First (foundation for everything)
Docker MCP Gateway & Toolkit (while Docker is fresh)
Goose (to connect to the MCP infrastructure)
Key things to be aware of during reinstall:

Docker Setup:

bash
# Install Docker
brew install docker docker-completion

# Start Docker Desktop and ensure it's running
# Then install Docker AI toolkit
docker pull docker/mcp-gateway:latest
Docker MCP Gateway Considerations:

The MCP Gateway runs as a Docker container and acts as a proxy between Goose and MCP servers
You'll need to configure the gateway to expose MCP servers on specific ports
Pay attention to the docker-compose.yml configurations in the MCP servers repo
Goose Configuration:

Goose will need to be configured to connect to the MCP Gateway instead of direct MCP servers
The connection will be through HTTP/WebSocket to the gateway rather than direct stdio connections
Make sure to configure Goose's extensions properly to use the gateway endpoints
Specific Setup Steps After Install:

Test Docker MCP Gateway:
bash
# Run the gateway
docker run -p 8080:8080 docker/mcp-gateway:latest

# Test with one of the official MCP servers
docker run docker/mcp-server-github:latest
Configure Goose Extensions:
Update Goose's configuration to point to gateway URLs instead of local MCP server processes
The gateway provides REST APIs that Goose can connect to
Potential Gotchas:

Port conflicts (gateway uses 8080 by default)
Docker network configuration for container-to-container communication
Authentication/API keys for MCP servers (especially GitHub MCP server)
Goose extension configuration syntax may be different for HTTP vs stdio MCP connections
This approach should give you much more reliable and scalable MCP server management compared to direct process spawning.




I'll be using the Google Gemini CLI tool for development alongside Goose. Can I run the Gemini CLI from Goose? Also can I ask Gemini's CLI tool to help me with Docker commands? Or can I somehow expose all of the Docker CLI commands to Goose so I can call them from Goose using natural language?

Edit
Yes, you can definitely integrate the Gemini CLI with Goose and expose Docker commands! Here are several approaches:

Running Gemini CLI from Goose: Since Goose can execute shell commands, you can call the Gemini CLI directly:

Goose can run gemini commands through its shell execution capabilities
You can ask Goose to "run gemini and ask it about Docker best practices" or similar
This creates a workflow where Goose orchestrates calls to Gemini for specific expertise
Exposing Docker CLI to Goose: There are multiple ways to make Docker commands available to Goose through natural language:

Option 1: Direct Shell Access (Built-in)

Goose already has shell access, so you can ask it to run Docker commands directly
Example: "Use Docker to list all running containers" → Goose runs docker ps
Option 2: Docker MCP Server (Recommended)

Use Docker's own MCP server for Docker operations
This gives Goose structured access to Docker APIs rather than just CLI commands
More reliable than shell commands and provides better error handling
Option 3: Custom MCP Server

Create a custom MCP server that wraps Docker CLI commands
Expose specific Docker operations as MCP tools
Can combine this with Gemini CLI calls for enhanced functionality
Option 4: Enhanced Shell Integration

bash
# You could create wrapper scripts that combine both:
# docker-with-gemini.sh
#!/bin/bash
docker "$@"
gemini "Explain this Docker command: docker $*"
Recommended Architecture:

Use Docker's MCP Gateway with the Docker MCP server for reliable Docker operations
Configure Goose to access Gemini CLI for expert advice/code generation
Let Goose orchestrate between Docker operations and Gemini consultations
This gives you the best of both worlds: Goose handling orchestration and file operations, Docker MCP for reliable container management, and Gemini CLI for expert advice and code generation.




image.png
what do we want to do here?
should I do a user install of Docker's CLI tools?

Edit
For your use case with Goose and MCP Gateway, I'd recommend keeping the "System" option selected for the CLI tools. Here's why:

Advantages of System install (/usr/local/bin):

Goose will automatically find Docker CLI commands without PATH configuration
MCP Gateway and other tools expect Docker CLI to be in standard system locations
No need to manually configure PATH for Goose or other integrations
More reliable for shell execution from within Goose
Your current settings look good:

✅ Advanced settings - gives you control
✅ System CLI install - standard location for tools
✅ Allow default Docker socket - needed for MCP Gateway communication
✅ Allow privileged port mapping - needed for MCP servers (many use ports < 1024)
✅ Automatically check configuration - helps catch issues
Keep these settings and click "Finish"

The only thing you might consider changing later is if you have conflicts with existing Docker installations, but since you did a clean removal, the system install should work perfectly for your Goose + MCP Gateway setup.

The privileged port mapping is especially important since some MCP servers might want to bind to standard ports (like 80, 443, etc.), and the Docker socket access is essential for the MCP Gateway to manage containers.




do i want to enable code completions?

Edit
Yes, definitely enable code completions for your setup! Here's why it makes sense for your use case:

Benefits for your Goose + Docker + MCP workflow:

Docker commands: Auto-complete Docker CLI commands, container names, image tags, etc.
Better integration: Goose can more easily suggest and execute Docker commands with proper syntax
MCP server management: Easier to work with container names and Docker Compose configurations
Development efficiency: When Goose is helping you write code/configs, completions speed up the process
Minimal overhead: Docker's code completion is lightweight and won't interfere with your other tools.

Works well with multiple tools: The completions will work in your terminal regardless of whether you're using Goose, the Gemini CLI, or working directly.

You can always disable it later if you find it intrusive, but most developers find Docker's completion very helpful, especially when working with:

Long container/image names
Docker Compose service names
Volume and network names
Command flags and options
So go ahead and enable it - it'll make your Docker workflow smoother whether you're working through Goose or directly in the terminal.




I'm gonna use the Docker VMM virtualization unless you tell me not to

Edit
Go ahead and use Docker VMM virtualization - it's actually a good choice for your setup! Here's why:

Advantages of Docker VMM:

Better performance: More efficient than the older HyperKit backend
Lower resource usage: Less CPU and memory overhead
Improved stability: Fewer weird crashes and hangs
Better integration: Works well with macOS's native virtualization
For your Goose + MCP Gateway use case:

Container performance: MCP servers running in containers will be more responsive
Network reliability: Better networking for container-to-container communication (important for MCP Gateway)
Resource efficiency: Leaves more resources available for Goose and other AI tools
No downsides for your workflow - Docker VMM is the modern, recommended approach on macOS.

The only reason to avoid it would be if you had specific compatibility issues with very old software, but since you're doing a clean install with modern tools (Goose, MCP Gateway, etc.), Docker VMM is the way to go.

It'll give you the best foundation for running multiple MCP servers and managing them through the Docker Gateway.

I haven't run the Github server yet. I had a concern about that. When I try to connect the Github MCP server to Goose it overloads Goose with tools. Goose likes to have less than 80 tools available. With Github's MCP server it goes well over 120. I'd like to use one (or more) of these official Github "toolsets" to limit how many tools I have in Goose. Can you help me pick which ones would be the best if all I really need from Goose is to read and analyze my repos? I will be doing most write operations with the Gemini CLI.

## Tool Configuration

The GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.

_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._

### Available Toolsets

The following sets of tools are available (all are on by default):

<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->
| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `context`               | **Strongly recommended**: Tools that provide context about the current user and GitHub context you are operating in |
| `actions` | GitHub Actions workflows and CI/CD operations |
| `code_security` | Code security related tools, such as GitHub Code Scanning |
| `dependabot` | Dependabot tools |
| `discussions` | GitHub Discussions related tools |
| `experiments` | Experimental features that are not considered stable yet |
| `gists` | GitHub Gist related tools |
| `issues` | GitHub Issues related tools |
| `notifications` | GitHub Notifications related tools |
| `orgs` | GitHub Organization related tools |
| `pull_requests` | GitHub Pull Request related tools |
| `repos` | GitHub Repository related tools |
| `secret_protection` | Secret protection related tools, such as GitHub Secret Scanning |
| `users` | GitHub User related tools |
<!-- END AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->
Edit
For your use case (reading and analyzing repos with minimal write operations), here are the optimal toolsets to keep under 80 tools:

Essential for repo analysis:

bash
--toolsets context,repos
Recommended minimal set:

bash
--toolsets context,repos,issues
If you need slightly more context:

bash
--toolsets context,repos,issues,pull_requests
Why these specific toolsets:

context - Must have

Provides user/org context and current repo information
Essential for Goose to understand what it's working with
repos - Must have for your use case

Read repository contents, file structures, commit history
Browse code, analyze project structure
Get repository metadata and settings
issues - Good for analysis

Understanding project context through issues
Seeing what problems/features are being discussed
Helps with code analysis in context
pull_requests - Optional but useful

Understanding recent changes and development patterns
Code review context
Only add if you stay under 80 tools
Avoid these for your use case:

actions - CI/CD not needed for analysis
gists - Not repo-specific
notifications - Too noisy
orgs - Unless working across multiple orgs
users - Not needed for repo analysis
discussions - Usually not critical for code analysis
code_security, dependabot, secret_protection - Security tools you won't need for reading
Test with the minimal set first:

bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 docker/mcp-gateway:latest --toolsets context,repos
This should give you exactly what you need for repo analysis while keeping tool count manageable for Goose.




isn't that the command to run the mcp-gateway server and not the Github server?

Edit
You're absolutely right! I mixed up the commands. The MCP Gateway is the proxy/router, but the GitHub MCP server is separate.

The correct command for the GitHub MCP server with limited toolsets would be:

bash
# Pull the GitHub MCP server
docker pull docker/mcp-server-github:latest

# Run with limited toolsets
docker run docker/mcp-server-github:latest --toolsets context,repos
The workflow is:

MCP Gateway (docker/mcp-gateway:latest) - runs on port 8080 as the proxy
GitHub MCP Server (docker/mcp-server-github:latest) - the actual server with GitHub tools
Gateway routes requests from Goose to the GitHub server
You'll need to configure the MCP Gateway to connect to the GitHub server, typically through a configuration file or environment variables that tell the gateway where to find the GitHub MCP server.

The --toolsets flag goes on the GitHub MCP server command, not the gateway command.

So your sequence would be:

Run the GitHub server with limited toolsets
Configure and run the MCP Gateway to proxy to it
Configure Goose to connect to the gateway
Thanks for catching that!




does it matter which directory I'm in when I run these commands?

Edit
For Docker commands - No, directory doesn't matter since you're pulling and running containers.

But for your workflow - Yes, it will matter:

Docker commands (current step):

bash
# These work from any directory
docker pull docker/mcp-gateway:latest
docker pull docker/mcp-server-github:latest
docker run docker/mcp-server-github:latest --toolsets context,repos
However, for the GitHub MCP server to be useful:

It will need access to your Git repositories
You'll likely need to mount your repo directories as volumes
Authentication (GitHub token) needs to be configured
When you get to the actual integration:

For Goose:

Run Goose from the directory of the project you want to analyze
Goose will have context about the current repo
For the GitHub MCP server:

bash
# You'll probably need something like:
docker run -v /path/to/your/repos:/repos \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token \
  docker/mcp-server-github:latest --toolsets context,repos
Recommendation:

Run the Docker commands from anywhere for now to test
When you're ready to analyze specific repos, cd to that repo directory before starting Goose
Configure the GitHub MCP server with appropriate volume mounts for your repos
For now, just test the basic Docker commands from your current directory to make sure everything pulls and runs correctly.

Edit
You successfully pulled the correct image (mcp/github), but you're still trying to run the wrong image name. Use the image you actually pulled:

bash
# Run the correct image with toolsets
docker run mcp/github --toolsets context,repos
You pulled mcp/github but tried to run docker/mcp-server-github:latest (which doesn't exist).

The correct sequence is:

✅ docker pull mcp/github (you did this successfully)
✅ docker run mcp/github --toolsets context,repos (use this command)
Try that and see if the GitHub MCP server starts up with the limited toolsets you want.




is there a way to easily check how many tools it has access to now?

Edit
Yes! There are a few ways to check the tool count:

Method 1: Check the container logs/output When you run the MCP server, it should log how many tools are available:

bash
docker run mcp/github --toolsets context,repos
Look for output that mentions tool counts or lists the available tools.

Method 2: Use the MCP Gateway to inspect The MCP Gateway can list tools from connected servers:

bash
# Run the gateway (in another terminal)
docker run -p 8080:8080 docker/mcp-gateway:latest

# Then check available tools via API
curl http://localhost:8080/tools
Method 3: Test with a simple MCP client You could use a basic MCP client to connect and list tools, but this is more complex.

Method 4: Check the GitHub MCP server documentation The toolsets documentation might specify how many tools each set contains.

Try running the GitHub server first and see what it outputs - many MCP servers log their available tools on startup. If it doesn't show the count clearly, the MCP Gateway approach with the curl command should give you a definitive list.

What do you see when you run docker run mcp/github --toolsets context,repos?




https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/tools/mcp-server.md#mcp-servers-with-the-gemini-cli
is it possible to connect the Docker Github MCP server to my Gemini CLI tool?
if so, how?

Edit
Yes! Based on the Gemini CLI documentation you linked, you can definitely connect Docker MCP servers to the Gemini CLI. Here's how:

Method 1: Direct Docker Connection The Gemini CLI can connect to MCP servers running in Docker containers. You'll need to configure it in your Gemini CLI config file:

json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp/github", "--toolsets", "context,repos"]
      }
    }
  }
}
Method 2: Via MCP Gateway (Recommended) Since you're already setting up the MCP Gateway, you can connect Gemini CLI to the gateway:

Run the GitHub MCP server:
bash
docker run --name github-mcp -d mcp/github --toolsets context,repos
Configure the MCP Gateway to route to it
Configure Gemini CLI to connect to the gateway:
json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "gateway": {
        "transport": "http",
        "url": "http://localhost:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
Benefits of this approach:

You get the limited GitHub toolset in Gemini CLI (perfect for your write operations)
Goose can connect to the same gateway for read/analysis operations
Single source of truth for your GitHub MCP tools
Easy to manage and configure
Workflow:

Use Gemini CLI for writing/modifying code (with GitHub MCP tools)
Use Goose for analysis and orchestration (also with GitHub MCP tools)
Both tools share the same GitHub context and capabilities
This gives you the best of both worlds for your development workflow!




how do I check if there's any running docker MCP servers?

Edit
Here are several ways to check for running Docker MCP servers:

Method 1: List all running containers

bash
docker ps
This shows all currently running containers with their names, ports, and status.

Method 2: Filter for MCP-related containers

bash
# Search for containers with "mcp" in the name or image
docker ps --filter "name=mcp"
docker ps --filter "ancestor=mcp/github"
docker ps --filter "ancestor=docker/mcp-gateway"
Method 3: List all containers (including stopped ones)

bash
docker ps -a
This shows both running and stopped containers.

Method 4: Check specific ports

bash
# Check if anything is running on common MCP ports
lsof -i :8080  # MCP Gateway default port
netstat -an | grep :8080
Method 5: Docker stats for running containers

bash
docker stats
Shows resource usage of running containers (Ctrl+C to exit).

Method 6: Check container logs

bash
# If you know the container name/ID
docker logs <container_name_or_id>
Since you haven't started any MCP servers as background processes yet, docker ps will likely show empty or just show any other containers you might have running. When you do start MCP servers, they'll appear in the docker ps output.




Run 'docker ai COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
user@Mac goose % docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
user@Mac goose %

Edit
Perfect! That confirms you have no Docker containers currently running, which is expected since you haven't started any MCP servers yet.

Now you can proceed with starting the GitHub MCP server. Try running it to see the tool output:

bash
docker run mcp/github --toolsets context,repos
This should start the GitHub MCP server with only the context and repos toolsets, and you should see output showing how many tools are available.

After you run this command, if you open another terminal and run docker ps again, you should see the container running (unless it exits immediately after showing the tool information).

If you want to run it in the background as a persistent service, you can use:

bash
docker run -d --name github-mcp mcp/github --toolsets context,repos
The -d flag runs it detached (in background) and --name github-mcp gives it a friendly name that will show up in docker ps.




condense all of the steps we've taken so far beginning with the first thing that we did right after I finished uninstalling everything. In other words, start with the very first step in the fresh install section of the steps. skip over any steps that didn't work or needed correcting. Only include commands which were successful. And yes I prefer to run it in the background as a persistent service and detached. output the steps as a well formatted markdown file.

Here's your condensed setup guide with only the successful steps! This should give you a clean reference for the Docker MCP setup process you've completed so far.

Edit
I see the issue! The containers started but then exited. Let me update the guide with the correct commands:


Docker MCP Setup Guide - Clean Install Steps
Document ∙ Version 2 
The containers exited because:

GitHub MCP Server runs on stdio (standard input/output) and is designed to be used interactively or via pipes, not as a long-running service
MCP Gateway shows "No server is enabled" - it needs configuration to know which MCP servers to connect to
The GitHub MCP server is working correctly (it shows "GitHub MCP Server running on stdio"), but it's designed to be used differently than as a background service. You'll need to configure the MCP Gateway to properly connect to MCP servers, or run the GitHub server in a way that the gateway can communicate with it.

This is more complex than initially expected - the MCP servers aren't designed to run as simple background services. They need proper integration configuration.

Edit
The MCP Gateway is working but needs configuration to know which MCP servers to enable. Let me search for the proper configuration:


Docker MCP Gateway configuration enable servers
10 results





















Based on the search results, I can see that Docker Desktop has an integrated MCP Toolkit with "one-click setup" and "integrated tool discovery" from the MCP Catalog directly in Docker Desktop 
Goose: An open-source, extensible AI agent that goes beyond code suggestions | Hacker News
.

The easiest way to set this up is through Docker Desktop's MCP Toolkit UI rather than command line:

Try this approach:

Open Docker Desktop (the GUI application)
Look for "MCP Catalog" or "MCP Toolkit" tab in the Docker Desktop interface
Enable the GitHub MCP server with one click from the catalog
This will automatically configure the MCP Gateway
If you don't see the MCP Toolkit in Docker Desktop, you may need to:

bash
# Check if you have the latest Docker Desktop version
# The MCP Toolkit might be in beta or need to be enabled in Docker Desktop settings
Alternative CLI approach (if the UI method doesn't work):


docker mcp CLI commands enable servers configuration
10 results





















Perfect! Based on the documentation, here's what you need to do:

Step 1: Enable MCP Toolkit in Docker Desktop

Open Docker Desktop (the GUI application)
Go to Settings → Features in development
Select "Enable Docker MCP Toolkit" and click "Apply" 
Docker MCP Catalog | Discover Secure, Top MCP Servers
Step 2: Use the MCP Catalog UI

In Docker Desktop, select "MCP Toolkit" and select the "Catalog" tab 
Docker MCP Catalog | Discover Secure, Top MCP Servers
Find the GitHub MCP server and select the "Plus" icon to enable it 
Docker MCP Catalog | Discover Secure, Top MCP Servers
Configure it with limited toolsets if the option is available
This approach will automatically:

Configure the MCP Gateway properly
Enable the GitHub MCP server
Handle all the networking and configuration
Try this UI approach first - it's designed to be the "one-click" solution that handles all the complexity we were running into with manual Docker commands. The command-line approach requires more complex configuration files that aren't well documented yet.

Let me know if you see the MCP Toolkit option in Docker Desktop!




image.png
if I use the desktop method how do I restrict the toolset?

Edit
Looking at your screenshot, I can see you're in the Docker Desktop MCP Toolkit interface with the GitHub Official MCP server. You can see it shows "Tools (80)" which is right at your limit.

Unfortunately, from what I can see in the UI, the Docker Desktop MCP Toolkit doesn't appear to have a toolset restriction option in the GUI. The desktop interface seems to enable all toolsets by default.

Your options:

Option 1: Use it as-is (80 tools)

You're right at your 80-tool limit for Goose
This might still be workable since it's exactly at the threshold
Option 2: Go back to CLI approach with configuration

Skip the "Add MCP server" button in Docker Desktop
Use a custom configuration file for the MCP Gateway that specifies toolsets
This requires more manual setup but gives you the control you want
Option 3: Test first, then decide

Click "Add MCP server" and test with Goose
See if 80 tools is manageable for your workflow
If Goose struggles, then switch to the CLI approach with limited toolsets
For the CLI approach with toolset control, you would need to:

Not use the Docker Desktop UI
Create a custom MCP Gateway configuration file
Manually configure the GitHub server with --toolsets context,repos
What would you prefer to try first - testing with all 80 tools, or going the more complex CLI configuration route for fewer tools?




give me instructions for option 2

Edit
Here are the instructions for Option 2: CLI approach with custom configuration:


Docker MCP Setup Guide - Clean Install Steps
Document ∙ Version 3 
Important Notes for Option 2:

Don't use the Docker Desktop "Add MCP server" button - we're doing this manually
You'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token:
Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
Generate a new token with appropriate permissions for your repos
Replace "your_github_token_here" in the commands above
Configuration file format may vary - the MCP Gateway configuration format isn't fully standardized yet. If the YAML approach doesn't work, you might need to try:
JSON format instead of YAML
Different configuration structure
Environment variables instead of config file
Troubleshooting steps if it doesn't work:
bash
# Check what configuration options the gateway supports
docker run docker/mcp-gateway:latest --help

# Check the gateway documentation
docker run docker/mcp-gateway:latest --config-example
Alternative approach if the config file doesn't work:
Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the GitHub MCP server and gateway
Set up inter-container communication
Try these steps and let me know what you see in the gateway logs. The configuration format might need adjustment based on what the MCP Gateway actually expects.




does it matter where I put the mcp-config folder? on macOS I have a ~/dev folder I use for all my projects and a /goose folder inside that for my goose related projects if that matters

Edit
No, it doesn't matter where you put it! Using ~/dev/goose/mcp-config actually makes more sense for organization. Let me update the instructions:


Docker MCP Setup Guide - Clean Install Steps
Document ∙ Version 4 

Docker MCP Setup Guide - Clean Install Steps
Document ∙ Version 5 
Benefits of putting it in ~/dev/goose/mcp-config:

Better organization - keeps all your Goose-related configs together
Version control - you can add this to a Git repo if you want
Easy to find - logical location within your development structure
Consistent with your workflow - matches your existing folder structure
The -v ~/dev/goose/mcp-config:/config part of the Docker command mounts that local folder into the container, so Docker can access the configuration file regardless of where you put it on your local system.

This approach keeps your MCP configuration alongside your other Goose projects, which makes a lot of sense organizationally!




would it be better to make a ~/dev/docker directory and put all my docker MCP stuff in there?

Edit
Yes, that's actually a better approach! Here's why:

Benefits of ~/dev/docker/ for MCP configs:

Technology-based organization - Docker/MCP configs are infrastructure, not project-specific
Reusable across projects - You might use these MCP servers for multiple projects
Cleaner separation - Keeps infrastructure config separate from project code
Scalable - Easy to add more MCP servers, Docker Compose files, etc.
Suggested structure:

~/dev/
├── docker/
│   ├── mcp-config/
│   │   └── gateway.yaml
│   ├── docker-compose.yml (for future use)
│   └── README.md (document your setup)
└── goose/
    ├── project1/
    └── project2/
Let me update the instructions:


Docker MCP Setup Guide - Clean Install Steps
Document ∙ Version 6 

Docker MCP Setup Guide - Clean Install Steps
Document ∙ Version 7 
This structure makes more sense because:

Infrastructure vs. Projects: Docker/MCP setup is infrastructure that supports multiple projects
Future expansion: Easy to add more Docker services, MCP servers, compose files
Clear boundaries: Goose projects stay in /goose/, Docker infrastructure stays in /docker/
Good organizational thinking!




https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli
Read this and tell me how to use Github Actions with the Gemini CLI to have Gemini's CLI make changes to my Github Repos on my behalf.

Edit
Based on the GitHub Actions documentation for the Gemini CLI, here's how to set up GitHub Actions to have Gemini make changes to your repos:

Basic Setup
1. Create GitHub Action Workflow Create .github/workflows/gemini-cli.yml in your repo:

yaml
name: Gemini CLI Automation
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      prompt:
        description: 'Prompt for Gemini CLI'
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  gemini-automation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Run Gemini CLI
        uses: google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli@v1
        with:
          prompt: ${{ github.event.inputs.prompt }}
          gemini_api_key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
2. Required Secrets Add these to your repo's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

GEMINI_API_KEY: Your Google AI Studio API key
Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has write permissions
Advanced Setup with File Changes
For Gemini to make actual changes to your repo:

yaml
name: Gemini Code Assistant
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  gemini-code-changes:
    if: contains(github.event.label.name, 'gemini-fix')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Gemini CLI with file context
        uses: google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli@v1
        with:
          prompt: |
            Fix the issue described in: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
            
            Issue description: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
            
            Please analyze the codebase and suggest specific file changes.
          gemini_api_key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
          include_files: "**/*.js,**/*.py,**/*.md"

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          commit-message: "🤖 Gemini CLI automated fix"
          title: "Fix: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
          body: |
            Automated fix generated by Gemini CLI
            
            Closes #${{ github.event.issue.number }}
Trigger Methods
1. Manual Dispatch: Run manually from Actions tab 2. Issue Labels: Trigger when you label an issue with "gemini-fix" 3. Push Events: Run on every push 4. Scheduled: Run on a cron schedule 5. PR Comments: Trigger with specific comments

Key Features
File context: Include specific files for Gemini to analyze
Write permissions: Gemini can create commits and PRs
Issue integration: Link fixes to specific GitHub issues
Automated PRs: Creates pull requests with Gemini's changes
This setup lets Gemini act as an automated code assistant that can analyze issues, suggest fixes, and create pull requests with the changes directly in your GitHub repos.




obviously I need to create a repo before I do any of this, based on what we know about my setup is there anything I should be aware of when setting up a repo that will make heavy use of Docker, the Gemini CLI and Github Actions?

Edit
Based on your setup (Docker, Gemini CLI, GitHub Actions, Goose, MCP servers), here are the key considerations for your repo structure:

Repository Structure
Create a comprehensive .gitignore:

gitignore
# Docker
**/.dockerignore
**/docker-compose.override.yml
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Goose
.goose/
goose-logs/
**/*goose*output*

# Gemini CLI
.gemini/
gemini-cache/

# MCP
mcp-config/secrets.yaml
**/*token*
**/*secret*

# macOS
.DS_Store
Essential Configuration Files
1. Docker Compose for your MCP setup: Create docker-compose.yml in root:

yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mcp-gateway:
    image: docker/mcp-gateway:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./docker/mcp-config:/config
    environment:
      - GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
2. Environment template: Create .env.example:

bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GitHub Actions Considerations
1. Required Permissions in .github/workflows/:

yaml
permissions:
  contents: write          # For Gemini to modify files
  pull-requests: write     # For automated PRs
  packages: read          # For Docker images
  actions: read           # For workflow access
2. Runner considerations:

Use ubuntu-latest for Docker compatibility
Consider macos-latest if you need macOS-specific testing
Repository Settings
In GitHub repo settings:

Actions → General:
Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
Set "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions"
Secrets and variables:
Add GEMINI_API_KEY
GITHUB_TOKEN is automatic but verify permissions
Branches:
Enable branch protection on main
Require PR reviews for Gemini-generated changes
Require status checks to pass
Directory Structure Recommendation
your-repo/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── gemini-assistant.yml
│       └── docker-mcp.yml
├── docker/
│   ├── mcp-config/
│   └── docker-compose.yml
├── docs/
│   ├── SETUP.md
│   └── GEMINI_PROMPTS.md
├── scripts/
│   ├── setup-mcp.sh
│   └── test-integration.sh
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
Special Considerations
1. Token Security:

Never commit tokens to Git
Use GitHub Secrets for all API keys
Consider using GitHub Apps instead of personal tokens for better security
2. MCP Configuration:

Keep sensitive MCP configs in .env files
Use Docker secrets for production setups
3. Goose Integration:

Document your Goose workflows in the repo
Consider adding Goose config files to version control (without secrets)
4. Testing Strategy:

Test GitHub Actions in a separate branch first
Set up staging/development workflows
Test Docker MCP integration locally before committing
This structure will give you a solid foundation for heavy Docker, Gemini CLI, and GitHub Actions usage while keeping everything organized and secure.




what's the word for Goose in japanese and 5 other random languages?

Edit
Here are the words for "goose" in Japanese and 5 other random languages:

Japanese: ガチョウ (gachō)

Other languages:

Russian: гусь (gus')
Arabic: إوزة (iwazza)
Finnish: hanhi
Swahili: bata bukini
Hungarian: liba
The Japanese word ガチョウ (gachō) is written in katakana since it's often used for domestic geese, though you might also see 雁 (gan) for wild geese.




which of the available open source licenses on Github is the most restrictive for those who use my code?

Edit
The GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) is the most restrictive open source license available on GitHub.

Why AGPL-3.0 is the most restrictive:

Network copyleft: Unlike GPL, if someone runs your code on a server and users interact with it over a network, they must provide the source code to those users
Strong copyleft: Any derivative works must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0
Patent protection: Includes patent grant and termination clauses
SaaS clause: Prevents companies from using your code in cloud services without releasing their modifications
Other highly restrictive options:

GPL-3.0: Strong copyleft but no network requirement
GPL-2.0: Similar but older version
EUPL-1.2: European Union Public License with strong copyleft
What AGPL-3.0 forces users to do:

Release source code of any modifications
Use compatible licenses for the entire work
Provide source code to network users (not just distributors)
Include copyright and license notices
Document changes made to your code
Result: Many commercial companies avoid AGPL-licensed code entirely because of these requirements, making it very effective if you want to ensure derivative works remain open source or force commercial users to negotiate separate licensing terms.

If you want maximum restriction while remaining open source, AGPL-3.0 is your best choice.




how do I add the permissions for workflows?
do I create a yaml file in .github/workflows as it shows?
what do I name the yaml file?

and where do I specify ubuntu-latest as my docker image(s)?

Edit
Yes, create YAML files in .github/workflows/

File Structure
your-repo/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── gemini-assistant.yml    # Main Gemini workflow
│       ├── docker-tests.yml        # Docker/MCP testing
│       └── ci.yml                  # General CI/CD
File Names
Use descriptive names with .yml or .yaml extension
Kebab-case is preferred: gemini-assistant.yml, docker-mcp.yml
Examples: main.yml, ci.yml, deploy.yml, gemini-automation.yml
Permissions Location
Add permissions at the job level or workflow level:

yaml
# Method 1: Workflow level (applies to all jobs)
name: Gemini Assistant
on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  packages: read
  actions: read

jobs:
  gemini-task:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ... your steps
yaml
# Method 2: Job level (more granular control)
name: Gemini Assistant
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  gemini-task:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      # ... your steps
Ubuntu-latest Location
Specify ubuntu-latest in the runs-on field of each job:

yaml
name: Docker MCP Setup
on: [push]

jobs:
  test-mcp:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    # <-- This is where you specify it
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up Docker
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
        
      - name: Test MCP Gateway
        run: |
          docker pull docker/mcp-gateway:latest
          docker run -d -p 8080:8080 docker/mcp-gateway:latest
Note: ubuntu-latest is the GitHub runner environment, not a Docker image. Your actual Docker images (like docker/mcp-gateway:latest) are specified in the Docker commands within your workflow steps.




oh wait, these are instructions for agentic workers?

Edit
Yes, exactly! The GitHub Actions + Gemini CLI setup is for creating agentic workers - automated AI agents that can:

Respond to GitHub events (issues, PRs, comments)
Analyze your code and make intelligent changes
Create pull requests with fixes or improvements
Act autonomously based on triggers you define
This is different from your Goose + MCP setup:

Goose + MCP (Local Development):

You interact with Goose directly
Goose uses MCP servers for GitHub access
Real-time conversation and development
GitHub Actions + Gemini CLI (Autonomous Agents):

Gemini acts independently when triggered
Responds to repo events automatically
Creates PRs and commits without your direct input
Example agentic workflows:

Issue labeled "bug" → Gemini analyzes code and creates a fix PR
New PR opened → Gemini reviews code and suggests improvements
Daily schedule → Gemini scans for security updates and creates PRs
Comment "/gemini refactor this" → Gemini refactors the code
So you're setting up two different AI systems:

Goose - your interactive development assistant
Gemini Actions - autonomous repo maintenance workers
Both can work together! Goose helps you develop, while the GitHub Actions agents handle routine maintenance tasks automatically.

Does this distinction make sense for your workflow?

read the 3 workflows documentation pages and help me write up 3 generic workflows for each in yaml format
The overall purpose of this repo will be to boilerplate an agentic workflow environment making heavy use of Docker, Goose, Gemini CLI, Github and the Docker Gateway

Agentic Gemini CLI Workflows for Docker/Goose Environment
Document 
I've created three comprehensive agentic workflows based on the Gemini CLI GitHub Actions patterns, specifically tailored for your Docker/Goose/MCP environment:

🔍 Issue Triage Agent - Automatically analyzes new issues, categorizes them by severity and component (Docker/Goose/MCP), applies labels, and provides initial responses.

🔬 PR Review Agent - Reviews pull requests with focus on Docker security, Goose integration patterns, MCP configurations, and overall code quality for agentic environments.

🚀 General Gemini Agent - A flexible workflow you can trigger manually for various tasks (analysis, documentation, refactoring, testing, deployment) with custom prompts.

Each workflow:

Initializes your Docker MCP Gateway infrastructure
Includes context about your specific tech stack (Docker + Goose + MCP + GitHub Actions)
Handles security considerations for your environment
Provides cleanup and error handling
Creates summary reports
These workflows will give you a solid foundation for autonomous AI agents that understand and work within your agentic development environment!
